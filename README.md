## Overview
We are tring to build a website about "Magic: The Gathering"  based on the DeckBrew API. Magic The Gathering is a trading card game, it has different kinds of spells, artifacts and creatures. The website will provide basic information about this game including videos or articles about basic rules. We can also search specific card by providing a search tab. On top of that, it should some fancy UI such as showing some animations when we switch cards or hover over a card.
